# Early Weather-Driven Stockout Alert

## Goal
Build a reproducible, 100% local and free MVP that detects potential stockout risks caused or amplified by extreme weather events.

## What you will get
- Public GitHub repository (Linux-first)
- PostgreSQL + Docker + Python/Dash app
- Reproducible scripts: ingest → weekly anomalies →  ML model → dashboard

## How it will be evaluated
- Reproducibility in a fresh Linux environment
- Ability to show weekly anomalies and weather impact
- Simplicity of the dashboard and code
