# extreme-weather-stockout-alert
Early Weather-Driven Stockout Alert: a simple, fully local and free MVP to anticipate stockout risk from extreme weather, reproducible on Linux. It uses open data (weather + sample sales), PostgreSQL in Docker, and a Python/Dash app to compute weekly anomalies, train a ML model, and display results.
